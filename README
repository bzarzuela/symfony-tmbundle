Credits
-------
Thanks for the work of 'Dr Nic' from the rails community. Without his work on the rails bundle I still wouldn't know how to create a bundle. Also many thanks to
'meandmymonkey' from the symfony community. He created the images which you can see in the html popups of the symfony commands. Big thanks to user 'everzet'.
He improved the html output windows and added the dialogs to the commands. And last but not least many thanks to 'fabpot'. He created the first version of the bundle.
